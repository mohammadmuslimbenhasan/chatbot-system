# Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files:

- `delivered.mp3` - Plays when a message is sent/delivered
- `loading.mp3` - Plays when searching for an agent

You can use any short sound effects (250-500ms) for these notifications. Recommended sources:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- Create custom sounds using audio editing software

The sound files are played using the `playSound()` function in `/lib/sounds.ts`.
